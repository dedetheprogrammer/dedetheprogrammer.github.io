## First sight of the portfolio

This would be the first vision of the portfolio I started two years ago. At this point, it would only be built with pure <span style="color:#ef652a">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#33a9dc">CSS</span>, and <span style="color:#f3db1c">JavaScript</span>, and it wouldn't have any content, just a loading screen, as I was studying at the time. The idea ended up putting aside.

## Second sight of the portfolio

Months after the first version, the first breakthrough was made in which it continued to be used pure <span style="color:#ef652a">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#33a9dc">CSS</span>, and <span style="color:#f3db1c">JavaScript</span>. This time, the sections were finally implemented, along with pure CSS transitions between them. However, the idea stalled there and was eventually discontinued.
