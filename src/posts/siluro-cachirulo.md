- A silly catfish in a cute and colorful pixelart artstyle!
- A soundtrack completely made ONLY with beatbox! (and a phone mic lol)

This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ggj-teruel-2025">Global Game Jam</a> in Teruel in 48 HOURS!

The GGJ is a worldwide jam where many countries participate. The theme was "BUBBLE", and we had little extra challenges! Those are doing the game with the next constraints:

- ONLY in **pixelart**, **256px** size max.
- All sounds must be made by using **beatbox** (**and a phone lmao**).
- Be **playable with one hand**.
- Represent **Arag√≥n**, the place where we are participating from!
